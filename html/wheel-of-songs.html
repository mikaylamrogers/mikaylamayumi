    <h1>Wheel of Songs</h1>

    <p>
        Over the past year, with the rise and advancements of AI technology, generating text and music has become increasingly common and popular. Music and technology companies have been experimenting with different ways to generate meaningful and realistic lyrics, compositions and sounds. One common aim of these companies, just like our project, has been to generate songs based on and similar to living or deceased artists that are loved. With our project, our motivation was to focus on using Python with the OpenAI API to generate meaningful lyrics of two deceased songwriters, as if they produced a song in collaboration.

        This web project was built in collaboration with Deniz Ko√ßak, Mila Georgieva, Dide Peker, Ahmad Alex Solh, and Chloe Choe.
